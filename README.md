This is a report on a qualitative data analysis conducted on a WhatsApp group chat with messages sent between January and April, 2023. In this report, I demonstrated data collection, cleaning, transformation, and visualization. With the information in the dataset, I will be answering a few questions to help group members gain insights on the interactions.

## Data Sourcing
I exported this data from my university class group chat with the permission on the group administrators. The data collected spans between 1st January, 2023 to 30th April, 2023. The focus of the dataset was on the date, time, names of group members, and messages.

## Modelling
I learnt to create date and distinct name tables. I also learned to model these tables using appropriate connections and keys.

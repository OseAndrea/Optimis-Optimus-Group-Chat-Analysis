This is a report on a qualitative data analysis conducted on a WhatsApp group chat with messages sent between January and April, 2023. In this report, I demonstrated data collection, cleaning, transformation, and visualization. With the information in the dataset, I will be answering a few questions to help group members gain insights on the interactions.

## Problem Statement 
The questions raised while working on this dataset are:
1. Who are the most active members?
2. Who are the least actve members?
3. What time do people chat the most?
4. What days do people chat the most?
5. Which month had the most activity?

## Data Sourcing
I exported this data from my university class group chat with the permission on the group administrators. The data collected spans between 1st January, 2023 to 30th April, 2023. The focus of the dataset was on the date, time, names of group members, and messages.

## Modelling
I learnt to create date and distinct name tables. I also learned to model these tables using appropriate connections and keys.

1. There are 65 active members on the group and the number of messages analysed are 967 (after cleaning).
2. The most active members in the group are Tracie, Gweke, Ikpemosi, Okoh, Ose~Andrea, Alexandra and Harriet.
3. The least active members are FelaBack, Fortune, PraiseEl, Akugbe, Barbie, Damilola, and Daniel.
4. The group is more active on the weekends with Fridays and Saturdays having the most number of messages.
5. Considering time, the group is most active at night with the highest peaks between 9:00pm and 10:00pm.
6. Within this time frame, February was the busiest month, and considering that the most used words are 'Happy', 'Birthday', and 'Congratulations', we can infer that there were a lot of birthday celebrations and goodnews in February.

## Challenges
1. Cleaning and sorting through the messages (especially those that had emojis).
2. Not being able to detect if messages were original or replies to other messages.

This project was an exhilarating learning opportunity for me. WThe challenges I experienced while cleaning the data helped me learn how to work with unstructured qualitative datasets.
